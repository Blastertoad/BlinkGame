# BlinkGame


Project created and shared by Jaden Drysdale aka BlasterToad

This project has been put together as a training resource for users to further their knowledge in and experiment with Unreal Engine and it’s visual programing language Blueprints.

###### Prerequisites: 
This project requires an install of Epic’s Unreal Engine 4.19 or later
To build an executable of the project you will also need Microsoft Visual Studio

###### Documentation:
I am trying my best to leave detailed comments on all blueprints in the project. Beyond this I will be highlighting parts of the project on my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/toadnet 
Video links will follow as uploaded.

###### Goals:
As a learning resource I plan to implement:
- Split screen multiplayer 
- Online multiplayer 
- Team based co-op play 
- Interactive menus 
- Key binding 
- System scaling settings 

Longshot goals are:
- Steam multiplayer example 
- VR mode 
- Multiple engaging maps 

###### Legal stuff:
As well as being a learning resource this is also a fan game based upon the Weeping Angels from BBC’s Doctor Who. I lay no claim to any naming or imagery directly derived or strongly influenced by the source material. This project is not for sale and no compensation is being gained from its existence or distribution.

With that aside the project is being released under the MIT licence so others can do with it as they will once downloaded.
